## 📂 Featured Projects

Here are my standout projects — each in its own repo for easy forking and collaboration:

1. **[High-Speed Async Web Extractor](https://github.com/MaxMayer1991/scraper_autoria)**  
   A professional-grade scraping solution designed for speed and efficiency. This project demonstrates the power of asynchronous processing to handle modern, JavaScript-heavy web applications.
   ### Key Features:
   * **Async Engine:** Powered by Scrapy-Playwright for non-blocking I/O operations.
   * **Modern JS Handling:** Seamlessly renders dynamic content that traditional scrapers miss.
   * **Robust Infrastructure:** Integrated Docker support for easy deployment and Proxy rotation to ensure high availability.
   * **Optimized Performance:** Fine-tuned concurrency settings for maximum data throughput.
   - ⭐ Stars: 0 (let's boost it!)  
   - 🛡️ License: MIT  
   - 🔑 Tech: Scrapy, Playwright, Docker, APScheduler  

2. **[Robust Data Orchestration Pipeline](https://github.com/MaxMayer1991/robust-scraping-orchestrator)**  

   A comprehensive data extraction and storage system built for reliability and long-term monitoring of automotive market trends.

   ### Architectural Highlights:
   * **Hybrid Approach:** Combines Scrapy's efficiency with Selenium's ability to mimic real human behavior.
   * **Advanced Resource Management:** Custom Driver Pool and Proxy Rotation middleware to bypass sophisticated anti-bot systems.
   * **Data Persistence:** Fully automated PostgreSQL integration with duplicate prevention logic.
   * **Automation & DevOps:** * Scheduled execution and daily database dumps via APScheduler.
   * Containerized environment using Docker-compose for seamless "one-command" setup.
   * **Data Schema:** Tracks comprehensive car attributes, including VIN, odometer readings, and contact information.

3. **[Project3-Name](https://github.com/MaxMayer1991/Project3-Name)**  
   (Extract and describe another one, e.g., a data analysis script.)
